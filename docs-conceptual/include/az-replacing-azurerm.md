> in the `Az` module. `Az` has a backwards compatibility mode with `AzureRM`, and is designed to be easy to switch to. To learn more
> about this new module and how to upgrade, see:

> * [Introducing the Azure PowerShell Az module](/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az)
> * [Install Azure PowerShell Az module](/powershell/azure/install-azureps-az)
> * [Migrate to the new Azure PowerShell Az module](/powershell/azure/migrate-from-azurerm-to-az)

> If you have deployments that use the classic deployment model that cannot be converted,
> you can install the Service Management version of Azure PowerShell. For more information, see
> [Install the Azure PowerShell Service Management module](/powershell/azure/servicemanagement/install-azure-ps).
